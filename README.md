# Authentication lesson

If you are reading this you have successfully downloaded the lesson repo for authentication. **Go You**.

The way this lesson is broken down uses the power of GIT. That is to say that we will be using branches to navigate from step to step.


#### How to navigate 
To See what branches are avalible type the command `git branch -a`.  You will see all the remote branches avalible in red, and your local *master* branch in white.The remote branches will look something like this `remotes/origin/step-1_packageJson`.  If you would like to move on to the first step you could type the command `git checkout step-1_packageJson` or the second step `git checkout step-2_express-boilerplate`.
